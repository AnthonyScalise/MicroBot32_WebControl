2. Open the driver station in your browser
3. Go to `Settings > Widget Configuration Settings > Profile` and upload the `calculatorDemoWidgetConfig.txt` profile
4. Under `Controller Input Settings` set the controller input mode to `GamePad`. This way there will be no gamePad widget by default unless you plug one in
